## Continuous reporting app for Waterways Chaplains

This is a shiny app that reads data from a Google sheet and displays it in a shiny app. The test app is currently located [here](https://church-army.shinyapps.io/waterways-test/).

The app is published manually from a local repo, so the remote may well be out of sync with the app itself.

## TODO:

- [x] Read from private Google Sheet via `googlesheets4`
- [ ] Visualise test data
- [ ] Design app interface
- [ ] Enable data download as xlsx and/or csv file
	- [ ] Needs to be cleaned (i.e. anonymised)
